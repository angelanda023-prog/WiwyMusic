# WiwyMusic — durable AI handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-31 (America/Mexico_City)

## Current production state

- Android app written in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3.
- Application ID: `com.wiwymusic`.
- Production release: `v1.0.35`.
- `versionName`: `1.0.35`.
- `versionCode`: `36`.
- Production commit: `4930a43` (`feat(settings): unify page design`).
- GitHub release: <https://github.com/angelanda023-prog/WiwyMusic/releases/tag/v1.0.35>
- OTA asset name: `WiwyMusic.apk`.
- Production APK SHA-256: `bf3192df75513e4f3a29c47460e26835304b13617b6ec4a2d3f6b070916ce0a8`.
- Previous production baseline: `v1.0.34`, commit
  `df99b71`.

The app updater reads stable releases from `angelanda023-prog/WiwyMusic` and expects an
asset named exactly `WiwyMusic.apk`. Relevant implementation:
`app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/utils/Updater.kt`.

## User decisions that must be preserved

- Do not use old UI mockups. User requested original, code-native UI work.
- A broad experimental visual redesign was tried and rejected. It was fully reverted before
  `v1.0.34`; do not restore it automatically.
- Maintain current architecture and playback behavior.
- Do not change APIs, databases, services, routes, or playback logic for visual work unless
  strictly required and explicitly authorized.
- Keep Spanish UI wording where supplied by user.

## Mini-player protection

Mini-player must remain exactly unchanged unless user gives explicit authorization after
receiving file, reason, risk, and alternative explanation.

Protected files/components:

- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/player/MiniPlayer.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/player/MiniPlayerComponents.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/player/Player.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/component/BottomSheet.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/constants/Dimensions.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/theme/Theme.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/theme/Type.kt`
- Playback service, queue, state, and connection logic.

`MainActivity.kt` is sensitive because it hosts root UI and player integration. In `v1.0.34`,
user explicitly authorized changing only the main `TopAppBar` title block. Do not use that
authorization for future changes elsewhere in the file.

If a future change appears to require protected code:

1. Name exact file and component.
2. Explain why modification is necessary.
3. Explain risk to mini-player/playback.
4. Offer an alternative that avoids protected code.
5. Wait for explicit authorization.

## UI state implemented in v1.0.34

### Home

Files:

- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/MainActivity.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/screens/HomeScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/res/values-es/strings.xml`

Behavior:

- Main logo and `WiwyMusic` wordmark match Settings: 40 dp logo, 12 dp gap,
  `Wiwy` in `onSurface`, `Music` in orange `#F5791F`, 22 sp extra-bold text.
- `Continuar escuchando` heading is always rendered. Its item grid appears when data is not
  empty.
- `Fijar en marcación rápida` heading is always rendered immediately below it. Its grid
  appears when pinned songs are not empty.
- Spanish resource `keep_listening` is `Continuar escuchando`.
- Spanish resource `pin_to_speed_dial` is `Fijar en marcación rápida`.

### Music recognition

File:

- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/screens/musicrecognition/MusicRecognitionScreen.kt`

Behavior:

- Uses the shared `WiwySettingsPageHeader`, exactly matching the Account settings header.
- Header contains the 40 dp app logo, `WiwyMusic` wordmark, version/plan, right-side back
  button, and page title `Identificar canción` below the branded row.
- Old `graphic_eq` icon and old `WiwyMusic` header text were removed.
- The duplicate in-content `Identificar canción` title was removed.
- Recognition state machine, microphone permission, audio capture, search navigation, and
  result logic were not changed.

### Unified settings pages in v1.0.35

Single sources of truth:

- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/screens/settings/WiwySettingsPageComponents.kt`
  - `WiwySettingsPageHeader`: Account-style branded header and title.
  - `WiwySettingsCard`: Account-style 24 dp, `surfaceContainerLow`, zero-elevation card.
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/component/Preference.kt`
  - Settings preference cards/groups use the same 24 dp, `surfaceContainerLow`,
    zero-elevation treatment.
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/wiwymusic/ui/screens/settings/SettingsDimensions.kt`
  - Settings group card radius is 24 dp.

All destinations opened from Settings now use `WiwySettingsPageHeader`, including Account,
Appearance, Player, Content, Privacy, Storage, Notifications, Update, About, Backup,
Changelog, palette/theme tools, integrations, Discord pages, Last.fm, Music Together,
PoToken pages, widget settings, custom background, recognition, debug, Android Auto, and
Always-on display. Each page title is rendered below the branded header row. The root
`SettingsScreen` intentionally keeps its existing Settings search action.

Special cards in Music Recognition, Storage, Update, and About were also normalized to the
Account card surface, 24 dp radius, and zero elevation. Functional inner controls and preview
cards retain their semantics.

Validation completed after these changes:

```bash
./gradlew :app:compileUniversalDebugKotlin
```

Result: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. Protected mini-player/player files remained unchanged.

## Audio quality state from v1.0.33

Preserve these four choices and Wi-Fi control:

- Ahorro de datos: 96 kbps.
- Normal: 160 kbps.
- Alta: up to 320 kbps.
- Automática: recommended, adapts to network.
- Additional switch: `Máxima calidad solo con Wi‑Fi`.

## UI changes in v1.0.36

- `AboutScreen` uses a full-size native `LazyColumn` without duplicated nested-scroll
  connections, allowing every contributor card to remain reachable.
- `WiwyProfileAvatar` is now an accessible button. Tapping any shared header avatar opens
  `AvatarPickerSheet` to take a photo, choose one from the gallery, or select a preset.
- Main navigation destination transitions are defined in `NavigationBuilder`:
  - Settings and Home enter from right to left.
  - Playlist/Library enters from bottom to top.
  - Search enters from top to bottom.
- `MainActivity.kt` and all protected mini-player/player files remain unchanged.
- Validation: `./gradlew :app:compileUniversalDebugKotlin` completed successfully.

## Build and verification

Common validation:

```bash
./gradlew :app:compileUniversalDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:testUniversalDebugUnitTest
```

Release build:

```bash
./gradlew --no-configuration-cache :app:assembleUniversalRelease
```

Use `--no-configuration-cache` after committing because `app/build.gradle.kts` reads the
current Git hash during configuration and stores it in `BuildConfig.GIT_COMMIT`.

Before publishing:

- Run unit tests.
- Confirm `git diff --check` is clean.
- Confirm only intended files changed.
- Confirm protected player files are unchanged.
- Verify APK reports expected `versionName` and `versionCode` with Android `aapt`.
- Verify signature with Android `apksigner`.
- Compute SHA-256.
- Never print signing passwords, tokens, `local.properties`, or `keystore.properties`.

Release APK output:

`app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk`

## OTA publishing workflow

1. Increment `versionCode` and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
2. Validate changes and tests.
3. Commit before final release build so embedded Git hash is correct.
4. Push commit to `origin/main`.
5. Build signed universal release with configuration cache disabled.
6. Verify signature, version, and SHA-256.
7. Copy/rename asset to `WiwyMusic.apk`.
8. Create public GitHub release `v<version>` targeting `main`.
9. Mark release Latest.
10. Verify GitHub asset digest matches local SHA-256.

Publishing a public APK is an external disclosure. Obtain explicit user authorization before
creating the GitHub Release.

## Codebase graph

Prefer codebase-memory MCP for code discovery. Project name:

`Users-wiwyzho-Documents-Web-WiwyMusic`

After meaningful code changes, refresh its index so future agents see current symbols and
relationships.
